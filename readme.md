### What I learned

I'm just starting out on web development (2 weeks in) and feel very satisfied with the result. I managed to get a better understanding of some simple concepts and learned a whole new subject - media queries.

A very nice step towards learning responsive designs:

```css - proud of this:
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .card-container {
        display: block;
    }
    
}
```
